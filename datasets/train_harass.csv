"This happened in a bus, public transport. It was in broad daylight. I was on my way to college and the bus wasn't that crowded. There was enough space for two people to stand back to back with big bags on 'em. This particular male was standing next to my seat. There was enough and more space behind him. But noooooo... He started rubbing his crotch against my shoulder, subtly at first and then very obviously. I made my discomfort very apparent. But he didn't seem to get it. I shifted inside my seat and so did he. I think the lady beside me knew what was going on but didn't say a word, neither did the people behind me nor the bus conductor.

"This article was written last year when this situation took place. I was barely entering 11th grade. Now, as I leave high school with flashbacks of this day and all the times my body has been the empty canvas for boys to splatter paint on, I will tell you the story of a 10th grader in Gurgaon.quotThe strangers lips grazed upon the ends of my cheek. My bruised arm was pinned down on the dusty grey ground of the room while I kept my alert eyes outside on the faces of unknown men in uniform. They smirked as the stranger slid his snakelike fingers down my body. He struggled to undo the button. I could feel my eyes turn red when I bit him hard into his shoulder and in a small voice said, No, I have to leave. I dont like this. I felt the empty liquor bottle against my legs and his hands against my flesh. I jerked up and pushed him aside. My head buzzed of alcohol and panic as I managed to stand up and look around. Did I really want this? He straightened up and pressed my frail body upon the naked wall. No, I did not. I pushed him aside and ran towards the open hall. Men of all ages stood on the railings, oblivious of the act. My cheeks burned of forced kisses and shame. Holding my shoes in my hands, I scurried through the staircase in the search of a known face. Who was I looking for? Who was I running from? I reached the cold lobby of an office. I stared at the entrance, and there he was my strange glaring at my anxious face. He shoved my stiff self on the closed elevator, seeking to unfasten my pair of shorts. He settled for forcing his slithering fingers down my waist. He whispered, I am going to finger you like an asshole, as I whimpered and hopped away from him. I felt the back of my clothes, seeking for a phone. It wasnt there. A rush of panic and exhaustion, and I fled out of the office to the hallway. I rummaged around the building, exploring every step I took earlier, to search for a prized possession. It was not there. My eyes burned even more now. Tears blinded my vision and settled on my raw cheeks. He was behind me. I rushed downstairs and headed for the busy road. It was broad daylight, as I scuttled barefoot in the search of my friend. It was too late. She was gone, and my stranger was behind me, grabbing my shirt. His strong hands ripped the cloth. My bare back became exposed to the blinking lights and stare of million nameless men. I cried for help but nobody cared enough to hear. I ran faster, without the possession of a phone, money or my bag. Why was I here? I gazed at the crowd nearby. I came to rest on a staircase. Tears ran down my face, unknown figures settled around me but in my head, I knew what to do. Him, I whispered as I strived to punch the familiar number down on a phone.Do you remember the moment when you were child and you had gone astray from your parents in a crammed up market place? How at that moment, you were devoid of any thoughts and the only thought of worth was how to get back to your safe haven? Do you remember the worry on their faces? That moment was of such magnitude. I shook back and forth, glancing through abundant faces, unable to see his delicate features muddled up with concern. Men and women walked past me, putting forward a helping hand but I did not trust them. It was a matter of minutes, when his agonized face rushed past me. I stood up and ran towards his open arms. The world stood still as he held me. I took in the accustomed smell of his cologne and felt a homesick wave crash on the walls of my head. Im scared, hes going to find me. I said, and that was enough for him to know. He took out a grey shirt from his bag and walked me out of the eyesight of alien people. Wear it, he murmured and propped his hand on my shoulders to pull me close. He rescued my other friend from the clutches of my stranger and his friends and departed from the cursed location. The ride ended at my house. He held my face and in a low voice, inaudible to my friend in the next room, asked me for a favour. Dont do anything stupid, he said anxiously, as if reading my mind. The state of my friend was beyond the category of wasted, and following his given duty, he picked her up from the marble floor and led her towards the societys gates. He waved a brief goodbye and timidly walked away from me.Sometimes, you dont need words to explain how you feel. Sometimes, you just know. Like that, I just knew. There, enfolded in his scent from his shirt, I felt possible. I was petrified from the episode, but his face made it easier to breathe in. Sometimes, you dont need to be dating or loving somebody for months to feel comfortable with. You dont need to kiss him, or even have him around you all the time. Just his nervous presence lingering around you in that moment is enough to demonstrate and establish a brief connection. He was my safe haven, even if for those few minutes. I was sorry that it was over but all the more glad, he was there for me. When he said those words on the phone, they were a formality. But standing there in the park, watching him walk towards the gates, I could feel it happening. It may not have been an episode of such importance for him, but for me, it changed everything.Im sorry that the dance ended, but there, in your arms, I swear the world stood impossibly still.quotI attempted suicide a few hours later, but I was saved.

I commute to Kurla from Kharghar daily and some perverts get on the train from Mankhurd and Govandi who not only pass lewd comments to every girl on the station. They do not differentiate between teenage girls or a woman in her late 40's their comments are alike and quite disturbing and fellow commuters say nothing to them. They get down at Kurla and then they start taking their chances while getting on the railway bridge. They always try to grope woman in pretex of crowd and other male passengers chose to ignore even after looking at the shameless act.I strongly feel that there should be separate bridge at all stations for women.,1,1,1

"Okay, so this incident happened last year i.e. 2015 when I'd finished my classes at Vashi and was heading towards the Vashi depot to take a bus to my place Kharghar, Navi Mumbai. So, I boarded a 504 numbered bus and took a ladies seat, window side! I was on a phone call, after a few minutes I realised that I was touched near my boobs from behind, for an instance, I thought it might just be the rod of the seat but later I realised it wasn't, it was somebody's hand trying to grab me up there. I caught hold of the man's hand right there, turned it, turned myself and abused him asking what he was upto, he was quite shocked, I am sure he wasn't expecting a girl to react that way, our men think we are scared of speaking out that way, but I did, I didn't fear. The bus conductor came to the site and pulled his shirt and put him down the bus. Well, this wasn't the only, later after 5 minutes, a man sat down beside me, he started touching my thigh, I bursted out on him even madly as it was just 5 minutes back that the first one had happened, I turned towards him, without giving a second thought, I literally slapped him, abused him again, I was angry, angry to what was happening with me, the people there in the bus hit him and even he was put down. So this happened, I didn't hesitate to do whatever I did,  it was necessary!I thought, my misery ended, but there was another lecher who was staring at me for most of the time. I complained to the conductor and forced him out of the bus too.",0,0,1

"1. I went to have a consultation/meeting for an upcoming ad shoot with a Radio Jockey(quite famous). And he attempted to rape me, but then let me go as I was screaming on top of my voice. I learnt my lesson, never go on a one on one consultations alone. We live in a really horrible world. I was just a 20 year old who walked out of that place scared and tears running down my face. But the next day when I looked back and wanted to sue him for that, I realized I don't have any witness or proof that can be given to police. There were times when I'd get worked up all of a sudden and think of how I could kill/ruin his life. If doing the same with his family members would bring a difference! Five years down the line, I've moved on with my life. But there are still times when I wonder how many girls has he done the same with.I don't remember the exact date or month.2. There was also one more incident in GRS Fantasy Park Bangalore in the year 2011. I was in the water park area with friends and we went further inside water. I was trying to swim and someone groped my breasts 23 times continuously. As I am not good at swimming I couldn't do anything, but I had seen the guy's face. But by the time I got out of water angry and hurt and disgusted, he was nowhere to be seen. I went home straight right away as I was already upset.3. Our engineering college was in an interior place. Me and my friends were returning from a movie, at around 7pm. Unfortunately there were no streetlights connecting the road to college. A bunch of guys came in a bike and slapped the bottoms of the girls, whoever they could reach. It was dark and the bikes were too fast, there was nothing much we could do.

"In the summer 2011 I stayed in Manju ka Tilla as I had just returned from Dharamshala. As a foreigner traveling alone,I would always stay in the guest houses here since the area felt safe. One morning at 9am, as I prepared to leave the guesthouse to take a train to Agra, I was cornered by an ear cleaner. It all happened very suddenly. He offered to clean my ears and when I said no, he pushed me against a wall of one of the side alleys just off the main street, and proceeded to touch my breasts and nipples. I somehow pushed him away and raced back to my guesthouse, but when the guy in reception ran out to try and find the ear cleaner, he was gone. Shocked and shaken up and upset as I was, I had a train to catch and headed down to New Delhi train station on a taxi. Once at the station, my driver called in a guy to help carry one of my bags. We agreed how much I would pay for this then and there, and he was meant to help me find my train. We reached the train and went into the 2AC section where I was traveling, which at the time was empty still. After putting down the bag he extended his hand to ask for more money. I said no and reached down for the agreed sum, by which time he started to feel up my thigh (and move up). I yelled back and told him to back off and get out! He then shook his head and said ok to the money, but when I gave him the rupees he grabbed my hand and put it on his erect penis. It was deeply disturbing. Luckily, as I was trying to free my hand from his grip, other people came into the train and he ran out the opposite end. That was 11 am. The people who traveled with me comforted me and made sure I arrived safely in Agra. It was one of the worst days of my life.",0,0,1

"I was walking down the 15th  main and just turned into the 16th cross in HSR layout sector 4 when I heard the sound of a scooter behind me.  So I moved to the left hand side of the road.  That particularly short stretch is a little dark as there are no houses on either side of the road and the trees are tall and thickly grown hiding the light from the street lamp.  After a couple of minutes I realised that the scooter hadn't overtaken me, just as I realised this and turned my head to see the scooter rider put out his left hand and grabbed my right breast.  I was wearing a thick sweater because it was late January and cold in the evening.  Even so I felt completely violated and screamed out an abuse. Fortunately the sound actually came from my throat.  When I realised that I shouted again.  He had grabbed my breast and taken off immediately but when he heard me abuse him loudly he stopped and turned and made as if to return, but at that moment a young man turned the corner and I think that made him take off fast.  I thought he would turn and get on to the 17th cross so I turned and went on to that road but he just disappeared.  I can still remember vaguely his face and the fact that he was on an old scooter  vespa or lambretta  and was wearing a jacket. For more than a month I was scared everytime I walked on the road and heard a vehicle behind me.  However, gradually with the support of friends and family and through prayer I overcame that.  I am a Professor, I train people to report crimes, to resist, to fight gender discrimination and all that and here was I a middle aged woman perceived to be strong and confident shattered by an incident like that.  It wasn't the first time but something like that had happened after a long time, I had let my guard down as I was on sabbatical at that time and rarely went out.  I didn't report to the police as I was I didn't know what I would tell them  no vehicle number, no definite description of the criminal.  I wish I had, just reporting that something like this had happened may have made the police alert.",0,0,1

"this report will allow you to understand why girls are forced to commit suicide. You might be seeing on tv and news these days, how girls commit suicide because of blackmailing and sexual harassment. This is my story. I am 15. I had gone to visit my friend and on her street i noticed a guy staring at me. He was 18 or 19. He even winked at me, whistled, commented and what not. I ignored him and paced to my friend's place. I told her about this incident and she was mad at me, she wanted to go and confront that guy. We forgot about him and talked about ourselves for the rest of the afternoon. In the evening, i was totally shocked when i saw the same guy enter my friend's house. she introduced him as her brother and that's when i was speechless. the guy grinned at me dirtily and went to his room. My friend that day had got me a dress and she wanted me to try it on and show it to her. I was in no mood, i was disgusted, i wanted to shout at her brother, tell my friend all about him, but i kept quiet. I succumbed to her pressure and went and changed my dress. After showing her the dress, when i was going back to change into my original one, i noticed him standing near the staircase smiling in an evil way. He blocked my way, held my hand and forced me to see a video on his one. I was horrified when i saw its my video while i was changing my clothes in the toilet. i started crying and begged him to delete it. he said he will only if i have sex with him. at that moment as i was pleading and begging, i don't know how i got the strength to slap him. my friend heard the noise and came out where we were, i told her everything, she was speechless and did not know how to react. she cried and said many things to her brother. things were never the same after that, neither was i.",1,1,0

"Is this how women get harrassed by police in Nepal?orWhat happened to me today.Let me tell you, what happened to me today. I wanted to get some food, while I was on my scooter, putting the signal, stopping and some seconds after, all of the sudden, somebody hit me on the scooter really hard with his bike. Luckily, there were many people around, but the driver ran away afterwards. He left behind his friend, that tried to run also, but people could hold him back. He had to go through all the charges, the driver, most probably not having a license, did never show up or tried to apologize. But this is not the story, I want to tell you here.What happened after, going to the police station, was even worse. Not, that things like this happened never happened to me already in Nepal before, but this was just ... hitting me much harder. Please consider also, that I was, obviously, under shock from the accident. Not only this, constantly police men at the Police Headquarters were making fun of me and making me look stupid. They treated me like if I was not capable, not being supportive, nor trying to help. They did not even talk to me properly. And they did not even try to talk to me in Nepali, nor English. They just talked to the male person (he was called my tourist guide), that I called after the accident and was with me, about the case, even if it was my scooter and he was not present during the accident. The only occasion, they addressed me, was when the chief of police, that was in charge started asking me for my number and called me sexy. Can you imagine, being in that kind of state of mind after an accident and police takes advantage of it?We are talking here about police headquarters in Kathmandu. This did not happen in any back room somewhere in nowhere, where it cannot be justified in any case also. This happened publically, with people being present and observing this. Nobody spoke up.Is this how the police treats women in Nepal?Having a very privileged position as a foreigner, I do not even want to imagine, how Nepali sisters get treated, who have no embassy at their back, which the police men are afraid of.Can this behaviour really be accepted and ignored? Is that the police, that should serve the public and protect the people?",1,0,0

"This incident occurred 6 months ago but i still feel it was yesterday because the shock was too bad.I was returning from my yoga class at 8 am. Normally I am with friends but that day I was alone. I walked past the church on the way home and 2 boys on a bike came towards me. They touched me and were staring at my chain and purse which I had in my hand. They could not snatch it at that time but they followed me and were staring at me.I stood there for a little while and was looking at them. The boy in the pillion seat continued to look at me but then they went away. I started walking back home. As I reached the Hanuman Temple, 2 other boys came from the opposite side on the bike. They stopped the bike and the pillion rider asked me where is the hardware shop. I told them I didn't know and they could ask someone else. Very few shops were open at that hour and there were very few people on the road. They said it was ok and just started moving.Suddenly the pillion rider grabbed my chain but fortunately he grabbed my dress instead and I used my presence of mind to lift my hand and hold onto my chain. My sleeve tore in the process and there were nail scratches on my upper arm. God saved me and my chain. They sped away on the bike.It appeared that the 2 boys on the first bike and the 2 on the second bike were working together in tandem. Many such incidents have occurred on this road. Now there is a policeman posted opposite the church.",0,0,1

"n the eyes of many, the offices of Pakistan are filled with lecherous bosses. All too often, working women have tales of their perversions the lesser ones include gaze and glance, the occasional grope, the unwanted text message, the innuendo the bigger ones include invitations to meet outside the office, over lunch or dinner  with plum assignments, promotions, job security and professional reputations hanging in the balance.Resignation is no guarantee of reprieve there are reference letters to be obtained, future employment to be worried about. In an expensive, inflationwracked and increasingly competitive Pakistani workplace, there are many women who continue to be targets for men with power.The arithmetic of want and need is in display divorced women, single mothers, the older and the unmarried are particularly vulnerable to harassment. In the words of one single mother who endured 10 years of harassment, the pursuit is constant, and any attempt to escape is punished further with denials of promotions and humiliation before colleagues. Coworkers, often witnesses, say nothing, eager to avoid a situation that could result in retaliation, a loss of their own positions. Sexual harassment from superiors is hence often coupled with isolation by colleagues who watch, witness and withdraw. The harassed are not only the persecuted but also the pariah.There is a law against all this in Pakistan. The Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, which will be six years old, is a thorough document. The code of conduct included in it defines harassment as any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual nature, or sexually demeaning attitudes, causing interference with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, or the attempt to punish the complainant for refusal to comply with such a request or is made a condition for employment.It goes on to add that the above is unacceptable behaviour in the organisation and at the workplace, including in any interaction or situation that is linked to official work or official activity outside the office.The abuse of authority, creating a hostile work environment, and retaliation are the three categories that mandate action against a harasser. Detailed stipulations are set out for the establishment of investigative committees, ombudspersons, etc, who are charged with resolving the issues raised. A range of penalties from censure to outright dismissal are postulated. All employers are required to display the code of conduct prominently on their premises.When the law was passed in 2010, it was feted as a success. It would take time for its provisions to change the culture of the workplace, the more circumspect said. Change comes slowly but a law is a first step a legislative commitment supported by elected representatives signals that the path ahead will be a different one, in this case one where the harassment of women in the workplace would not be permitted.Not much has happened since then. Harassment is still rampant in the workplace (the majority of workplaces have little idea as to what the code of conduct is, let alone of the requirement to display it visibly in employee areas).Women still regularly report being verbally harassed and even physically assaulted by their superiors who, making calculations regarding their need for a job, their desire to get ahead, their inability to refuse, unabashedly continue with such acts. In the face of unwanted advances, Pakistans women continue to find themselves alone, unsure of where to take their complaints and how to protect themselves.Even in the development sector, where the very agenda of many organisations is to empower women, similar problems persist. In one, a cofounder of an organisation faced so much harassment by a male colleague that she was ultimately forced out. New, more pliant women hired to take her position have since complained of similar problems. The man in question, however, remains untouched, undoubtedly displaying similarly harassing behaviour to new prey. Other men have come to his defence  perhaps recognising their own behaviour in those of others and eager to ensure that no one gets punished.Misogyny is manufactured in two major flavours in Pakistan. The first is on the premises of religious obscurantists whose hankering for the reinstatement of a strictly segregated society sees the harassmentfilled workplace as a grim substantiation of their warnings. Women should not be in the workplace at all, the male conscience is unable to police itself.The second, one that wrongly labels itself as liberal and progressive, imagines it to mean a licence to harass and harangue. A womans willingness to put up and shut up is, in its mind, the product of this progressivism, its illogical mindset equating women in the public sphere with women sexually available to all men who may want them. The two flavours compete, their poisons infecting the working lives of women  doctors, lawyers, shopkeepers, bankers, teachers, professors and countless others  who are daily forcefed these bitter morsels of misogyny.Laws alone cannot change society the sexual harassment of women (and nearly everyone who reads this article either knows someone or is someone who has faced harassment) continues because it is considered permissible, something women ask for when they leave their homes.This belief is reflected all the time and everywhere in Pakistan, in soap operas that vilify working women as predators out to seduce innocent men, to workplace conversations in which men dissect the desirability of their female colleagues, their participation often a measure of a masculinity that fears competition from women. In the matter of sexual harassment in Pakistans workplaces, there are the guilty and the very guilty, they are far too many men complicit, quiet, eager to embrace or enforce their right to harass.",0,0,1

"This incident has happened to me twice in the same area with the same man, over a period of two years. In January 2014, the mentioned man, then a slightly chubby, balding guy, had crossed my path while i was just a block away from my home. He looks decent, and uses a bike which i now realise, has license plates that are half broken or absent. he then crossed me and came back, stood on the opposite side of the road with his penis sticking out of his pants and asking me to take a look. he was masturbating. I was too shocked to react and by the time I did ,, he had taken off on his back. Recently, the same man, who is now balder and fatter, once again crossed my path on the same road, this time i was near my building. the man was once again on a bike, but a nicer looking black and red sports bike. He had worn shorts and t shirt that people wear to a gym. all black. he came back, again maintaining a safe distance from me, this time he said very derogatory and vulgar things about my private parts, along with what he wanted to do with them. seeing him again , triggered memories of 2014 and i was frozen for a second, but once again when i did react he escaped on his bike. to me he now seems like a serial molester, with a modus operandi of targeting girlswomen in that area, in the wee hours of morning, on a bike with no plates. I am certain he lives in that area too.",1,1,0

I was going to work one afternoon and walking down the road near Maharaja Signal. I saw a group of many men around 1015 men in this area. They all seemed like they were from the Northern Part of India. I was in a decent salwar kameez covered in a dupatta. One of the men in the group yelled at me saying quotI love youquot in a very demeaning manner. Again this seems to be politically motivated by the elite white skinned North Indians who consider themselves to be gods and goddesses whereas the brown skinned and black skinned South Indians are creeps and the evil witches of India The white skinned North Indian women are considered innocent and angels from heaven. The problem is because I am a brown skinned woman with blemishes on my skin. So I am called a creep. I wonder who the real creeps are? The men who catcall at the woman and the men who pass sexual advances at a woman at 8 pm in the night or the educated black skinned south indian women who are treated like quotnaukraanisquot by the elite North Indians who consider themselves to be superior to other because of the color of their skin. I wonder who the real creeps are. The men who rape and inflict harm or who women get raped. I wonder who the real creeps are the people who treat women like objects of their sexual desire or the women who have the courage to step out of their homes to educate themselves and fight for their grades? Why doesn't these so called elite North Indians give their rapists a US visa and ask them to educate themselves in a foreign country if they have the courage instead of belittling black skinned South women who have made something out of themselves in the world?,1,0,0

"The following is what i had written a day after this horrific experience 23 years back.quotTeri chut lene me maza aa jaegaquot he said to me. Maybe it is my fault. I never should have known what that means. And I replied with quotmar ja jakequot, my voice quivering. And as with every sharp exchange of words, later, for quite some time I thought of better responses I could've given. quotPolice ke pass chalega? mujhe bhi maza aa jaega..quot or quotquot well thoughts I am still not able to put into words. Suddenly I was given a glimpse of what it would feel like to be a rape victim. It probably would be too clichd to say that I suddenly felt exposed to everyone around me. At the same I could see indifference in many eyes around me. They knew not what had just happened in the middle of the road, in broad daylight (please note that I am still speaking like a rape victim). I saw a mother with a daughter probably 810 years old with her. The gap of about 1m between them made me feel insecure for them. I wanted to shout out to the mother to grasp her daughter's hand and hold her close. And I suddenly understood why mothers are so protective. I knew he was still somewhere around me. Watching. Loving and getting high on the reaction he'd caused in me. This thought made me lighten up. I didnt want to give him the satisfaction. I looked around cheerily again. Well not really, just normal enough. All the men around me suddenly seemed to be leering. A casual glance felt like a perverted gaze. I wished my pickup to be here already. The stupid 20 something year olds that I have encountered innumerous times suddenly began to seem threatening. Who am I to judge? I know sex addicts. I have 1st hand experience with them and their lust and what their addiction does to people around them. Suddenly a thought comes to me. He had guts. I mean at this stage in his addiction (Im assuming that I am not blunderously attractive and he just says this kind of thing to young girls), he probably does it out of compulsion, but he must have started somewhere. I dont know a single person who would say out loud something like this, even in a relationship, during a naughty role play night. This I believe is tougher than proposing to a girl. Or maybe it isnt for him. Maybe he was brought up in a family in which an angry father told his daughter off with heavy abuses, the mother was openly told by the father that she is to pleasure him tonight, the siblings would call each other swear words involving their mother, the sister was casually called prostitute and told to do things wives are fit for.PS Please note that the date n time are approximates.",1,0,0

Besides this, after exiting from the underground bridge and as you walk towards Shivar Guest House, there are always huge groups of men, including shop keepers sitting all along the wholesale clothes shops going towards the BMC Quaters, who not only make lewd remarks, they also make sexual remarks, and sometimes even attempt unwanted contact. Worse cases have been witnessed but no action has ever been taken. This is just not a fixed group, there are always gangs at this entire area and specially at nights, the lane towards Laxmi baug and the BMC Quarters has a lot of mini ladders where these gangs sit as soon sun sets, and the number increases as time passes and it becomes worse at nights.",1,1,1

"Hi, The following incident has happened twice with me while walking back home. I was walking in the lane adjacent to kasarvadavli naka leading towards Thane Muncipal Garden side between 8 to 10 pm. Boys passing towards the direction I was walking stopped by..checked me out right on my face and drove ahead. I gave a firm rude look but did not get into verbal fight as the lane was not lit. there were very few people passing by. The most surprising thing... I was dressed in Salwar Kameez on one occasion. Alert One  There is a cheap liqour shack prior Haware residential Project via the lane i was walking...the boys were heading in the same direction which means they either belong to the slums nearby or were heading to chill out at the liquor shack. Alert Two  The place ahead of the liqour shack is deserted ... I have noticed rickshaw drivers and other local boys frequenting this place. Liqour is consumed in open.....I have seen it. The road gets spilt in two directions one to haware proect.. the other heads to a valley like place which is deserted....police needs to have their presence felt here.... Alert Three  These lanes are half lit and some spots completely unlit with street lights Please do something asap about this before a rape / crime takes place. The nearest police station is kasarvadavali police station. many thanks for this website....",1,1,1

But i was alone and the huge lane around FICCI was completely dark and deserted except a few ice cream vendors or men loitering around.

"Four or five recent events of violence and abuse, and the public reaction to them, merit comment. First, it is amazing how distinctions are being drawn by many between language used inside the parliament and outside. Let me begin with unreservedly condemning Defence minister, Khwaja Asifs, comment on opposition leader Shireen Mazaris voice his rhetorical request to make her voice feminine and the use of the term truck trolley.Mohammed Hanifs insightful piece on the subject correctly identifies these remarks as harking to patriarchal expectations of how everything woman should conform to a standard set by a male how men in this society feel  to dictate terms, behaviour, dress and even tenor of voice to a woman. From anyone else it would have been bad enough, but from a member of parliament and a cabinet minister, everyone expects a higher standard of restraint and control over his anger.However, the seriousness with which this is being debated and protested in the parliament makes me a little perplexed. When the same parliamentarians indulge in, and see, much worse language and behaviour outside the parliament in public spaces, on national television and social media, how do they expect to have it not creep into the house? Arent they the same people, talking about each other outside and inside the house? Indeed, arent their supporters and we all a part of the same society? I was dismayed, but not too surprised by the altercation in the house between Ms Mazari and Khwaja Asif.I am more surprised at the indignation, given that the indignant people know very well how low the standards of any kind of discourse have plunged all around us.The same PTI, that is up in arms right now (rightly), has never bothered to condemn or be indignant about the utterly obscene abuse hurled at their sisters and fellow citizens who oppose them politically. One is witness to such language, abuse and misogyny on social media and television day in and day out. PTI leaders language and abuse for their male opponents from atop containers and on television shows is no secret either, hence I do not feel the need to repeat it here.Other parties, too, have been guilty of similar behaviour, though not to the same cesspit extent. But they certainly are guilty of acting surprised when something like this happens on the floor of the house. They should have been condemning and boycotting those who have played an active part in dragging standards of discourse so low that one is afraid to even speak for fear of abuse.One of the guilty parties is certainly the media. Everyone knows which channels or show hosts love to create situations that might give dividends in the shape of some abuse, salacious slurs, a few slaps, punches or glasses of water and coffee thrown about. Why then do those who claim to be above it all not boycott these channels and shows? Why does every MNA, MPA, advisor, activist, economist etc.still behave like a media whore and grace shows of hosts they know encourage abuse, fights and bad language to obtain ratings? Why do they act all sanctimonious now?It is appalling that leading lights of several opposition parties continued to spend all their energies and time, and use up all of the medias energy and time on the so called TORs for the Panama Leaks commission day in and day out. It seemed as if nothing else was happening in the country as if everyday there was not a report of a woman being burnt alive for honour, or some other equally horrifying or serious issue that could merit their attention. But the self serving focus on going after the Prime Minister to the exclusion of all other duties was disgusting to say the least.Ones ears oozed with pus at the nonstop months long hyena shrieking press conferences and appearances on TV shows on the Panama TORs. It was only when the fourth girl in four days was murdered that leader of the Senate, Raza Rabbani, took notice and tasked the senate to do something about it  after which everyone made it their cause. This is the level of apathy towards the plight of the people generally, and to the growing violence towards women.Is our rulers apathy, and the resultant impunity from violence against women, exactly not the reason that Senator Hamdullah (I cant believe he is a senator) of the JUI thought he could, in the presence of several people in the studio, and on national television, level not only the most explicit, pornographic and filthy abuse at well known rights defender and columnist Marvi Sirmed, but also thought he could beat her up? What he did, and tried to do, in public should demonstrate to everyone the level of apathy towards violence against women in this country it should demonstrate to everyone what is going on behind closed doors. If this man thought he could, and would, get away with what he was doing, it should tell all something about the state of this society.So fearless is the JUI, and sure of support from the ruling party and the government of the day, that after the day befores assault on Marvi Sirmed, Hafiz Uzaifa Shakir of JUIF yesterday released a video saying, hum Pashtun gali ka jawab goli se dete hein (we Pashtun respond to abuse with bullets).It is tragic and heartbreaking that not a single PMLN leader has publicly condemned the JUI senator for reasons of political expediency. It is brave women like Marvi Sirmed who stand to support elected governments it is people like her who stand to protect the democratic project but the democrats we support and protect forsake us at these crunch times that are true tests of democratic norms and values.",1,0,0

"I once visited GB road area which is near the  New Delhi Railway station. Lot of my pervert friends suggested me to pay a visit. Roaming there casually, I initially saw 23 Police check posts and a primary school which puzzled me if it was really the Biggest Red Light Area of Delhi I've heard of. Walking swiftly to clear my confusion, I was attended by brokers who mistakenly(or intentionally) interpreted me as their potential customer. Quite surprised seeing no fear on their faces while promoting an illegal act of prostitution, I went ahead to explore more about the situation. Sneaking inside some of the 100's of brothels, I was depressed to notice girls of less than 12 years raising up their skirts to lure me up !Curious to know more, I started asking questions from the bookies about the monetary aspect of it(i.e the charges ). We were completely taken aback bylistening the offers.Twas pretty much around 200 bucks for an orgasm(Single shot as they call ) and around 800 for 1 full night. This was not even half of what we expected !Still curious before I end my little journey to almost a hell, I enquired the inside details and experiences of those pathetic youngsters leaving the brothels in numbers of hundreds.Twas so awful to hear the procedure of it.One has to choose among hundreds of prostitutes inside the brothel. Having chosen, the money is paid in advance to the cashier. A receipt is provided along with the number of your turn.And there you go after waiting in a balcony and being offered almost every thing you would like to drink or eat !Some horny youngsters also advised us to visit only Brothel 64 as the others have a poor reputation of looting people once their job is done.It is a clear violation of human rights of the prostitutes who are on with their job around 1617 hours a day !I am sorry to write so less about it as I am out time right now.I would be quite happy although to mail you a detailed writing soon.This is the first time I've got a platform to express my concern on this.So keep it up)",0,0,1

"It was my first day in Bangalore(after spending 4 years in Delhi). My kitchen was not yet set up hence we(me and my male friend) went out for dinner to a restaurant which was located at a very central area. At about 1030PM, we were done with our dinner and while heading towards my car which was parked about 500 meters from the restaurant, four men(looked like in their forties) started calling me out, saying 'excuse me', on turning towards them, they started teasing me, passing comments like 'miss you', 'hello' and all. My friend got furious with them but I somehow managed to convince him to get into the car and  We chose not to react. However, my friend asked me to stay inside the car and went out to note down their car number. These men seemed to notice him note down their car number, and after a while, they started man handling him. Fortunately I had a 'Naga chilly spray' with me. I took that out, ran towards them and managed to knock out three of them with the same. The fourth man got hold of my hand and pushed me down the road, and I hit my head. The saddest part was that people around were watching as if there is a drama being played on the road. Nobody came for help. While my friend was busy at the other end trying to fight with the rest of them, I saw one of the men take out iron rods from their car dickey. I pulled my friend telling him no one is gonna come for help and we will not be able to help ourselves either. We ran towards the car and immediately went inside. On turning the car to take a Uturn, two or three of them came running towards us with the intention to hit us, but since we were already inside, they smashed all sides of my car glasses. We rushed to the nearest police station asking for help. On showing them their car number(which my friend luckily noted down), the police personnel hesitated to file an FIR(As per our understanding, they seemed to be local/political goons residing in the same area. We left my car at the police station for the night, returned home at about 3AM in the morning and again went back to the police station for filing the FIR. After repeated failed request, we had to use my friend's position(he is in the army), we spoke to the head of that police station and filed the FIR. I was totally devastated from inside and wanted to leave Bangalore the very day. I cried the whole night and asked my friend to drop me home, maybe for a month, or two, or maybe forever, but I woke up the next day, and decided to fight this out. Being a woman living alone in the city, with 'different' looks and a car that these people can easily identify, I didn't want to get into the mess of making rounds at the police station, and court case(my friend also had to leave for work in few days), I decided to take back the FIR but also stay back in Bangalore and move on. We looked for a new house the very same day and I moved to a farther and safer house. It may be a question on someone's head as to why I withdrew the FIR and didn't try to punish those culprits. But we all know that the country that we live in. Even murderers are set free from punishment, leave aside eve teasers and people who made injury to us physically and damaged our property. This is a story, not only because I want to share one, but it shows how our own country has failed to protect its own citizens, a story of the faith that a woman doesn't have in her country's governing authority, a story that shows how we humans lag in being a helping hand when others are in need(yes, there were families watching the incident), a story to tell, that no matter how much hatred the world puts into you, you still need to have a love for humanity, a story, hoping that we(women) shall overcome from all these pain one day.....",0,0,0

"This incident occurred years ago and I faced a number of harassment after that too but this is the one which affected me the most.

We were returning after a very good day in a overcrowded bus. A guy started eveteasing me, all sorts of comments. He managed to get a sit next to me and I was cornered. He did not allow the bus conductor to come and take ticket from me. While all this was happening he was insisting on knowing my name. One of my good friends who is now a doctor and a faculty in a premiere institute reveal my name and other details to me. Till date I failed to understand whether she did not understand what she was doing (naive???) or she  did it on purpose (we were competitors in school). Ultimately my torture came to an end by a quick stop at the police station. My friend only laughed when I asked her the justification of her actions. Time has passed by... and I am Mother now.

"The place is sector 16 of Vashi, Navi Mumbai. It was 10.30 PM, as I got down at the sector 16 bus stop from BEST 525 bus and started walking towards home. The footpath is shady without street lights, so I decided to walk along the road. As I was walking, someone loudly screamed from the footpath ... quotae idhar idhar dekhquot. I involuntarily turned in that direction to see a guy (a labourer) masturbating himself and smiling at me as he did so! I was schocked but I didn't wait around. I just turned my back on him and walked away briskly to the spot where there are lights and where there was crowd. He kept following me for sometime but after he found out that I was headed in a direction where there were many people, he turned around and went his way.I was shaken as I reached home. All I felt was fear. But now that I'm reflecting on it, it feels I should have punched him for good. However, running away was all I could think of at that moment!",0,0,0

"Harassment is a blow any girl can suffer anywhere. Harassment is not necessarily an attack by just strangers, it can be an intense assault within the confinements of your house you considered your home. Here I am typing my own story of an account which shook my life and left it scarred in a way that I attest as irreversible. On an eventful Sunday, I returned home to an eerie silence. The tension in the air was palpable and the looks in the eyes of my dad were unmistakably of anger. I kept quiet and walked to my room, hoping that I was just worrying for no reason. I slouched on my bed with a slice of chocolate cake and tuned into my favorite channel on TV. Two hours later I was summoned by my Dad for a discussion and I knew at that very moment that all my fears will materialize in a span of few seconds. I come from a conservative family, where I am the only girl who is working in a corporate, who is career oriented, and independent in her thoughts and actions. Truly liberal and yet righteous in my thoughts, I have never questioned my approach towards life. I have been constantly put down by my family, I have incessantly been compared to my elder brother, my thoughts have been suppressed, and my ideals have been questioned. That night, my dad was furious for I was out on a Sunday with my friends for a social cause, in a mixed group of girls and guys, which was unacceptable to him though God knows why he coeducated me though God knows why despite being an educated man, his thoughts were shallow and hurtful as they demeaned women. He was in a rage that I was too independent for his governance and societal norms. He considered my independence and will to make a mark as insolence and immoral. He wanted me to be confined to the four walls of my house, preparing myself to get married without even realizing my dreams. As I sat there objecting, he asked for my phone and decided to cut me off from my social circle. He crushed my brand new phone to pieces and threw the broken pieces right at my face, the shattered screen leaving scratches wherever the tiny broken glasses pricked me. As I further relented, he hurled abuses and called me names a father can never associate with his own daughter. My tears had dried listening to it all, I was feeling stronger and motivated to not succumb to this harassment this was the worst I had seen and somewhere it brought me to peace that I had already faced the worst. I constantly defended my education, my career, and my strong ideals against his baseless , autocratic, and barbaric thoughts. I would call it barbaric as I could have never imagined that my own father would move agitatedly around looking for a knife in the kitchen to further harm me. That just killed every emotion I could associate with a fatherdaughter relationship. I stood upto him and looked him in the eye and told him that this was the worst thing he could ever do and he shall never be forgiven. Our relationship ended that night and I havent spoken to him eversince. As I walked out of that room, and not that house, just for the sake of my mother, I wept endlessly in my room, not able to fathom what just happened to me and why. My dads extreme behavior, the silence of my mother, and the fear in my brothers eyes made me realize how shallow our society is how can we even call it a society where ones life means nothing just because she is a girl. Who allows them to believe that women are weak or inferior?  There is absolutely no logic, no rationale, and absolutely no forgiveness for anyone who cannot respect a woman, be it our own parents. I know of so many girls who are living a far more dreadful existence and I have penned my story not for sympathy, not for appreciation for standing up for myself, but simply to encourage all the women and men reading this to propagate an understanding of how beautiful, divine, and amazing women are as gods creation. I want us all to make a society where every woman is safe, happy, and successful where every woman is an equal to every man. Do not cry, do not lose hopes, and do not deprive yourself of education as that is your true independence and absolute achievement. As we pin the creeps across the cities, and enlist all the crime spots around us, we need to realize that women are suffering at the hands of their own families. A true movement of women safety will begin when all the women stand up for themselves. Only when you respect yourself will the world respect you. Stay strong, stay safe!",0,0,0

"It happened on the night of December 1st when I went along with my friends for dinner.After finishing our dinner,I left the restaurant along with one of my friend.As we are living in a town where girls don't roam around after 8pm.Though it was the main centre of town,very few shops where open and all I could do was find for an auto soon to reach our college hostel.While I was standing out of the restaurant on the road,suddenly a bike passed by me and one guy sitting on the back hit my butt.It all happened so fast that I couldn't react and by the time I came to my senses,he rode fast.There where few gang of boys in the front who were waiting for us to pass by them.They were laughing at this incident though they seem to look educated!!(I know education doesn't matter much,its just the upbringing).I have come to this town(Bhimavaram) last year for studying dentistry.There are so many educated people here and also many Richi rich's but that doesn't make the town better.It is the people who make it the BEST and the people here are dirty minded!
