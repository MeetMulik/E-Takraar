The Tardeo Diana bridge is a very unsafe area especially afternoon times and on holidays. a lot of harassment and chain snatching incidents are happening very often as there are many escape routes especially towards the railway lines. Similarly the small lane below the bridge near Bai RFD Panday GIrls High School and the staircase from the bridge leading to the below parsi colony always has drug addicts and such types of people hanging around drinking and smoking drugs. The bridge is so unsafe that a debris truck since the last 3  4 years every month practically dumps an entire truck load of debris tight on the bridge and no body has yet caught him. Imagine what can happen to a woman in such an area....The main problem is that the bridge is divided into two police stations and perhaps neglected for the same reason.,0,1,0

"This is one of the most talked about incident to be heared from the people living in the vicinity of the 5th block colony, koramangala, bangalore. A man covered in black masque would perform activities that would horrify the people especially students staying in that particular location. This  mostly happens during the afternoon at around 530 600, though the timings diversify. A man stops at one of the shady location right in front of the Baithani high school and sometime it would be right outside Lakshmi park, he would try to seek attention or imbibe fear on the minds of people walking alongside the road and most of it would be done when a girl would pass by him. This are things which is considered not so normal in our society, things like opening your undergarments and showing your most private areas especially to young teenage girls. it happens most of the time in the evening when college going girls would come out of their hostel or pg's for a stroll. The reason is yet not known by anyone and even police are still searching for these masque men .",0,0,0

"I think there is no woman who has not gone through some form of sexual harassment in this country. It is sad that I cant step outside my home without a hint of fear in my mind. I have had experiences standing at my bus stop as a child, with a friend of mine waiting for my school bus to come, when a man in a big car took rounds throwing pieces of paper with his number written on it. Then there was another time when I was standing outside my house waiting for a friend to come pick me up when a car stopped and refused to leave until he saw my friend come. For God's sake right outside my house?!? I would like to state another example when me and my friend were returning from the market in a rickshaw and we were followed by a car full of men passing lewd comments and the rickshaw guy had the sense of taking a different route. When he dropped us home he asked us quotDidi kya aap un logo ko jaanti thiquot? and i replied saying no, and his answer was quotisliye maine doosra raasta le liyaquot. What i'm trying to say here is that it is not just the poor and uneducated people to blame every single time, there are quoteducated menquot from well to do families in big cars doing this!!! Another time i was stopped by a well spoken man on the defence colony  kotla road again in a big car asking if i want to be friends and whether he can drop me home, when i said no he kept following me, i had to go to a crowded place in my market in the colony to get away from him. Another thing i would like to say is that the I am a resident of Defence Colony which is quotsupposedlyquot a colony for the defence people, should be safe but sadly it isn't. Nearly every evening i notice prostitutes standing in nooks and corners amp cars stopping and picking them up inside the colony itself. There are a number of lady boys who stand right at road that turns into Defence Colony opposite the Lajpat Nagar metro station. At the turn there is a police check post at night for so called quotsecurity reasonsquot and they stop cars as and when they want (only when they're bored or want to make some money). Do they not know that these lady boys/prostitutes stand there and get picked up every night??? What is the police doing??? It happens right under their noses and they're oblivious to it!!! This is a great initiative but i hope it continues and is not short lived. We really need to do something to bring about a change in the mindset of people in this country which ironically worships goddesses !!",1,1,0

I was travelling with my family and we were in Gurgaon. A girl with a boy came on bike and the girl was wearing croptop and jeans. Two boys in a car came behind them and we all stopped on traffic signal and those boys were smoking cigarettes. When the boys saw the girl they put their burning cigarettes inside the jeans of the girl from back side and ran away and the girl was screaming of pain. I noticed the people standing over there saying that it was the fault of the girl as she was wearing short clothes and her body was uncovered. I mean this was seriously so shameful and ridiculous. Instead of showing sympathy towards that girl everyone standing there was blaming her and her dressing sense. Why don't you teach your sons to behave in respectful manner? One similar incindent happened with me when I was in 5th standard i was wearing short top and skirt and went to my neighbours house with my mom. There my aunt told my mom to not allow me to wear these kind of clothes as this will affect their daughters thinking. I mean are u guys serious one side you talk about modern India modern society and development and on the other side you are still carrying this orthodox thinking of yours that girls should be covered. I want to ask all the girls that don't u think babes these guys need to change their thinking and not us to change our dressing style,0,0,1

I was travelling around north west India with a tour group.  We had a group leader who was an Indian man.  On one of the days we went on a walking tour around various parts of Delhi.  At one point we stopped to have some chai made by a chai wallah on the street.  We watched him make it and our guide explained to us in English. When the chai wallah had finished making some for me he passed me the glass and then proceeded to pat on my buttocks.  I was shocked and surprised.  He then proceeded to do it to another female in the group after me.  Our tout leader noticed and shouted abuse at the chai wallah.  We then left shortly after.I realise this happened quite a long time ago but I thought it worth it to let everyone know that it happened.,0,0,1

"It is very common in Kanpur while you are walking on the left side of the road, someone from behind will pass you and reach for your breasts as it happens in a flash before you realize someone is behind. Or if you are traveling in a cycle rickshaw, near the road divider men usually come and stand just to grope you. Infact while on a pillion ride with a female companion, men do not feel hesitant to grope you from behind.

"I was returning home from a night out with some friends. I had had exactly half a bottle of beer (pls note that this does not even fall under the category of 'alcohol drinking') since I was driving. At a police checkpoint, I was confident but respectfully asked if they could have a lady officer checking my alcohol content on the breathalyser due to a prior shocking incident where the police pulled out my keys and made me blow into the breathalyser 4 times since they couldn't find alcohol on my breath. Of course, this time round I was smarter and more cautious and did not fall victim much prior to them repeating the horror...or so I thought! The inspector said that 'they will not touch me and feel me' so I should cooperate with them testing my breath. However, I found that disrespectful and did not lower the window. They then clamped my car and began to shoot a video. I waited for somebody I know to come and when that happened, used the breathalyser. Of course, the alcohol content was negative and they made me blow a second time. By this time, we argued to be let go and left the place. How are we to feel safe when the police themselves do not strive to instill that confidence in women? After all this, they say that women should not even be out on the streets after sundown! Absolutely ridiculous. Lets work towards a safer future. Together.",0,0,0

"I am a UK National who visited India from January 15th 2014 to January 26th 2014. Whilst on a train from Jodphur to Delhi on Friday 24th January with my male partner I was the victim of a crime. There was a samosa vendor on the train who served us food but who came back later to our carriage and was caught by me, concealing himself in the carriage whilst masturbating and staring at me. Both myself and my partner confronted the man and we were assured by the train guard that he had been removed from the train.On arrival into Old Delhi train station a few hours later we went to try to report this incident but there was no clear sign of where we could find the police so we left it until the following day. On Saturday 25th January we searched the internet and saw that crimes against women could be reported at Connaught Place so we went to that police station. Our treatment there was shameful as I was rudely ordered to write a statement about the incident in a room full of male police officers who were watching what we were doing. At the end of this time we were told that the incident could not be reported at Connaught Place police station and were vaguely direct back to New Delhi police station. Here we encountered a similar situation with the police showing very little interest in us and directing us to another police station. At this point we decided to come to the British Embassy to seek advice but were not allowed entry as we were told the embassy was closed on a Saturday. By now I was exhausted and traumatised so my partner took me back to our hotel and went out on his own to try to the report the incident. He eventually went back to Old Delhi train station and was finally able to find a police officer who was willing to listen to an account of the incident and to document it.",0,0,0
